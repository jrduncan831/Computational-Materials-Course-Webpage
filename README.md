# Computational-Materials-Course-Webpage
I created, populated, and maintained my course and research group webpage.  The course webpage includes Linux, Python, HTML tutorials as well as introduction to techiques for local and global optimization used in computational chemistry.  All tutorials may not be visible to public when teaching this course in the Spring semester. [Click here to view my course webpage] (http://fri.oden.utexas.edu/fri/)

## Example starting files for labs
This github page includes a small portion of the starting files needed to complete these tutorials which I highlight below.

### Lab 2 Part 2 and Lab 3
[Lab 2 part 2] (http://fri.oden.utexas.edu/fri/Labs_2019/lab2/lab2B.php) and [lab 3] (http://fri.oden.utexas.edu/fri/Labs_2019/lab3/)  walks students through implementing gradient descent starting with a 1D problem and builds up to a high dimensional chemical system.  This lab also introduces students to tools in the atomic simulation environment (ASE) and Transition State Library for ASE (TSASE). 

### Lab 5 Part 1
[Lab 5 Part 1] (http://fri.oden.utexas.edu/fri/Labs_2019/lab5/part1.php) introduces students to the fundamentals of molecular dynamics simulations and how to select appropriate parameters like the finite difference time step.
